# Adapted Tools

Here it is my goal to share tools that I have adapted for my own use-cases. Mostly, this is a place for me to put convenience wrappers for my own research. 

## Available modules

* [cDNA-detector (batch mode)](./_cDNA_detector)
* [DESeq2 (batch mode)](./_DESeq2)
* [csv_to_MD](./_csv_to_markdown_table)
